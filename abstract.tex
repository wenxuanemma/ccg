It is critical to ensure that network policy remains consistent 
during state transitions. However, existing techniques impose a high
cost in update delay, and/or FIB space. 
We propose the Customizable Consistency Generator (\name), 
a fast and generic framework to support {\em customizable} consistency policies
during network updates.
%under temporal uncertainty about the network state.
\name effectively reduces the task of {\em synthesizing} an update plan 
under the constraint of a given consistency policy to a {\em verification} problem,
by checking whether an update can safely be installed in the network at a particular time,
and greedily processing network state 
transitions to heuristically
minimize transition delay. 
We show a large class of consistency policies
are guaranteed by this greedy heuristic alone;
in addition, \name makes judicious use of existing heavier-weight
network update mechanisms to provide guarantees when necessary.
As such, \name
nearly achieves the ``best of both worlds'': the efficiency
of simply passing through updates in most cases, with
the consistency guarantees of more heavyweight techniques.
Mininet and physical testbed evaluations
demonstrate \name's capability to achieve various types
of consistency, such as path and bandwidth properties,
with zero switch memory overhead and up to a $3\times$
delay reduction compared to previous solutions.



%Modern networks are dynamic. 
%It is critical to ensure that network policy remains consistent during state transitions.
%However, %as networks evolve,
%the inherent distributed and asynchronous nature of networks causes
%any single point incapable to control the exact timing of network events, 
%any single point of the network uncertain about the 
%instantaneous global state to some extent, thus making the problem harder.
%ultimately leading to inconsistency between desired policy and actual network behavior.
%The emergence of Software Defined Networking doesn't change the fact, 
%despite having a logically centralized interface. 
%Existing mechanisms only guarantee some fixed consistency notions, 
%regardless of system requirement and performance overhead.

%We propose the Customizable Consistency Constructor (\name), 
%a fast and generic framework to support {\em customizable} consistency policies
%as networks evolve.
%during network transitions under temporal uncertainty about the network state.
%\name leverages a black-box approach and 
%introduces a graph-based uncertainty-aware network modeling technique.
%\kevin{\name effectively reduces the task of synthesizing an update plan 
%\cut{for preserving}
%\wxznew{under the constraint of} any given consistency policy to a general verification problem.
%We develop a novel network modelling technique allow us to reason networks even under temporal uncertainty, and build our verification engine based on it.
%By checking whether an update can safely be applied in a network at a particular time, the basic scheduling component of \name greedily processes network %state transitions to heuristically minimize transition delay.}
%For a given consistency policy, \name synthesizes an update plan that heuristically minimizes transition delay, \wxznew {by reducing a synthesis problem to a %verification problem.}
%We identify the scope of consistency policies that are guaranteed by that heuristic.
%\name also gives network operators a flexible choice to balance consistency and efficiency during network updates.
%For policies out of that scope, \name triggers a heavyweight plug-in mechanism that guarantees the required policies, when and only when necessary.
%In:addition, \name's greedy update scheduling algorithm can easily be integrated with existing network update mechanisms for significant speed improvements with the same level of consistency enforcement. 
%In that way, \name nearly achieves the ``best of both worlds":
%the efficiency of simply passing through updates in most cases,
%with the consistency guarantees of more heavyweight techniques.
%Both Mininet and physical testbed evaluations demonstrate \name's capability to achieve various types of consistency, such as trace and bandwidth properties, %with close to zero switch memory overhead and up to a factor 3x delay reduction compared to previous solutions.


%The complexity of networks attract more and more efforts to make sure they behave correctly. 
%One way to do so is to verify network-wide data plane state, 
%which utilizes the uniform format of data plane and is able to detect control errors. 
%However, none of the various data plane verification tools take the uncertainty into account.
%They effectively assume that the updates are applied at exactly the moment the they see them.
%In other word, being uncertain of the network status make some bugs neglected.
