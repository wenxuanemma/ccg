\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

In general, we're at the early stages of network verification and programmability

for example, how the various pieces fit together -- programming languages, verification layers, etc.

VeriFlow does much more than just verify invariants.  It is a real-time representation of the network's exact behavior.  

  2. Planning how to avoid transient errors (the ones that detects)

  3. Uncertainty due to having multiple controllers and not being able to see the entire network

  3 would also relate to debugging across ISPs or different regions controlled by different SDN controllers.
